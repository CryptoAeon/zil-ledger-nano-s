// This code also serves as a walkthrough for writing your own Ledger Nano S
// app. Begin by reading this file top-to-bottom, and proceed to the next file
// when directed. It is recommended that you install this app on your Nano S
// so that you can see how each section of code maps to real-world behavior.
// This also allows you to experiment by modifying the code and observing the
// effect on the app.
//
// I'll begin by describing the high-level architecture of the app. The entry
// point is this file, main.c, which initializes the app and runs the APDU
// request/response loop. The loop reads APDU packets from the computer, which
// instructs it to run various commands. The Zilliqa app supports three commands,
// each defined in a separate file: getPublicKey and signHash.
// These each make use of Zilliqa-specific functions, which are defined in zilliqa.c.
// Finally, some global variables and helper functions are declared in ux.h.
//
// Each command consists of a command handler and a set of screens. Each
// screen has an associated set of elements that can be rendered, a
// preprocessor that controls which elements are rendered, and a button
// handler that processes user input. The command handler is called whenever
// zil_main receives an APDU requesting that command, and is responsible for
// displaying the first screen of the command. Control flow then moves to the
// button handler for that screen, which selects the next screen to display
// based on which button was pressed. Button handlers are also responsible for
// sending APDU replies back to the computer.
//
// The control flow can be a little confusing to understand, because the
// button handler isn't really on the "main execution path" -- it's only
// called via interrupt, typically while execution is blocked on an
// io_exchange call. (In general, it is instructive to think of io_exchange as
// the *only* call that can block.) io_exchange exchanges APDU packets with
// the computer: first it sends a response packet, then it receives a request
// packet. This ordering may seem strange, but it makes sense when you
// consider that the Nano S has to do work in between receiving a command and
// replying to it. Thus, the packet sent by io_exchange is a *response* to the
// previous request, and the packet received is the next request.
//
// But there's a problem with this flow: in most cases, we can't respond to
// the command request until we've received some user input, e.g. approving a
// signature. If io_exchange is the only call that blocks, how can we tell it
// to wait for user input? The answer is a special flag, IO_ASYNC_REPLY. When
// io_exchange is called with this flag, it blocks, but it doesn't send a
// response; instead, it just waits for a new request. Later on, we make a
// separate call to io_exchange, this time with the IO_RETURN_AFTER_TX flag.
// This call sends the response, and then returns immediately without waiting
// for the next request. Visually, it is clear that these flags have opposite
// effects on io_exchange:
//
//                                      ----Time--->
//    io_exchange:        [---Send Response---|---Wait for Request---]
//    IO_ASYNC_REPLY:                           ^Only do this part^
//    IO_RETURN_AFTER_TX:  ^Only do this part^
//
// So a typical command flow looks something like this. We start in zil_main,
// which is an infinite loop that starts by calling io_exchange. It receives
// an APDU request from the computer and calls the associated command handler.
// The handler displays a screen, e.g. "Generate address?", and sets the
// IO_ASYNC_REPLY flag before returning. Control returns to zil_main, which
// loops around and calls io_exchange again; due to the flag, it now blocks.
// Everything is frozen until the user decides which button to press. When
// they eventually press the "Approve" button, the button handler jumps into
// action. It generates the address, constructs a response APDU containing
// that address, calls io_exchange with IO_RETURN_AFTER_TX, and redisplays the
// main menu. When a new command arrives, it will be received by the blocked
// io_exchange in zil_main.
//
// More complex commands may require multiple requests and responses. There
// are two approaches to handling this. One approach is to treat each command
// handler as a self-contained unit: that is, the main loop should only handle
// the *first* request for a given command. Subsequent requests are handled by
// additional io_exchange calls within the command handler. The other approach
// is to let the main loop handle all requests, and design the handlers so
// that they can "pick up where they left off." Both designs have tradeoffs.
//
// On the other end of the spectrum, there are simple commands that do not
// require any user input. Many Nano S apps have a "getVersion" command that
// replies to the computer with the app's version. In this case, it is
// sufficient for the command handler to prepare the response APDU and allow
// the main loop to send it immediately, without setting IO_ASYNC_REPLY.
//
// The important things to remember are:
// - io_exchange is the only blocking call
// - the main loop invokes command handlers, which display screens and set button handlers
// - button handlers switch between screens and reply to the computer
