// This file contains the implementation of the signHash command. The files
// for the other commands will have the same basic structure: A set of screens
// (comprising the screen elements, preprocessor, and button handler) followed
// by the command handler itself.
//
// A high-level description of signHash is as follows. The user initiates the
// command on their computer, specifying the hash they would like to sign and
// the key they would like to sign with. The command handler then displays the
// hash on the device and asks the user to compare it to the hash shown on the
// computer. The user can press the left and right buttons to scroll through
// the hash. When the user finishes comparing, they press both buttons to
// proceed to the next screen, which asks the user to approve or deny signing
// the hash. If the user presses the left button, the action is denied and a
// rejection code is sent to the computer. If they press the right button, the
// action is approved and the requested signature is computed and sent to the
// computer. In either case, the command ends by returning to the main screen.
//
// Keep this description in mind as you read through the implementation.

// Define the approval screen. This is where the user will confirm that they
// want to sign the hash. This UI layout is very common: a background, two
// buttons, and two lines of text.
//
// Screens are arrays of elements; the order of elements determines the order
// in which they are rendered. Elements cannot be modified at runtime.
static const bagl_element_t ui_signHash_approve[] = {
	// The background; literally a black rectangle. This element must be
	// defined first, so that the other elements render on top of it. Also, if
	// your screen doesn't include a background, it will render directly on
	// top of the previous screen.

	// which signing key is used. Hence, the first UI_TEXT points to a
	// compile-time string literal, while the second points to a buffer whose
	// contents we can modify.
	//
	// There is an important restriction here, though: the elements of a
	// screen are declared const, so their fields cannot be modified at
	// runtime. In other words, we can change the *contents* of the text
	// buffer, but we cannot change the *pointer* to the buffer, and thus we
	// cannot resize it. (This is also why we cannot write ctx->indexStr: ctx
	// is not const.) So it is important to ensure that the buffer will be
	// large enough to hold any string we want to display. In practice, the
	// Nano S screen is only wide enough for a small number of characters, so
	// you should never need a buffer larger than 40 bytes. Later on, we'll

// The command begins when zil_main reads an APDU packet from the computer
// with INS == INS_SIGN_HASH. zil_main looks up the appropriate handler,
// handleSignHash, and calls it. handleSignHash reads the command data,

// flag. Control returns to zil_main, which blocks when it reaches the
// io_exchange call.
//
// UX_DISPLAY was called with the ui_prepro_signHash_compare preprocessor, so
// that preprocessor is now called each time the compare screen is rendered.
// Since we are initially displaying the beginning of the hash, the
// preprocessor hides the left arrow. The user presses and holds the right
// button, which triggers the button handler to advance the displayIndex every
// 100ms. Each advance requires redisplaying the screen via UX_REDISPLAY(),
// and thus rerunning the preprocessor. As soon as the right button is
// pressed, the preprocessor detects that text has scrolled off the left side
// of the screen, so it unhides the left arrow; when the end of the hash is
// reached, it hides the right arrow.
//
// When the user has finished comparing the hashes, they press both buttons
// together, triggering ui_signHash_compare_button to prepare the approval
// screen and call UX_DISPLAY on ui_signHash_approve. A NULL preprocessor is
// specified for this screen, since we don't need to filter out any of its
// elements. We'll assume that the user presses the 'approve' button, causing
// the button handler to place the hash in G_io_apdu_buffer and call
// io_exchange_with_code, which sends the response APDU to the computer with
// the IO_RETURN_AFTER_TX flag set. The button handler then calls ui_idle,
// thus returning to the main menu.
//
// This completes the signHash command. Back in zil_main, io_exchange is still
// blocked, waiting for the computer to send a new request APDU. For the next
// section of this walkthrough, we will assume that the next APDU requests the
// getPublicKey command, so proceed to getPublicKey.c.
